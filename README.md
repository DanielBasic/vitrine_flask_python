# vitrine_flask_python

This project represents my personal journey in web application development, where I've honed my skills in web application design, acquired proficiency in SQL, mastered front-end development, and embraced the power of Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration.

Within this repository, you'll find a simple yet meticulously crafted Vitrine application, designed using the Flask framework. It serves as a testament to my exploration of modern web technology, coupled with my effective utilization of Git for version control and GitHub for collaborative development.

My expertise spans the domains of back-end logic, database management, front-end aesthetics, and the orchestration of collaborative coding workflows through Git and GitHub.
